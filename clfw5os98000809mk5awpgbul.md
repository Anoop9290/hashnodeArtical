### What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, object-oriented programming language used primarily for creating dynamic and interactive web pages. It is a client-side scripting language that is executed by web browsers. JavaScript can manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page, enabling dynamic updates of the content and appearance of a web page without requiring a page reload.

### History of JavaScript

JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in just 10 days in May 1995, while he was working at Netscape Communications Corporation. The language was initially named Mocha, which was later changed to LiveScript, and then finally to JavaScript. The name JavaScript was chosen by Netscape for marketing purposes, as Java was a popular programming language at the time.

In September 1995, JavaScript was first introduced as a scripting language for the Netscape Navigator web browser. The language gained popularity quickly and was later adopted by other web browsers like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome. In 1997, the first version of the ECMAScript standard was published, which defined the language specification for JavaScript.

### Setting up your development environment

To start coding in JavaScript, you need to set up your development environment. You can use any text editor like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom to write JavaScript code. You will also need a web browser like Chrome or Firefox to run and test your code.

Writing and running your first JavaScript program

To write your first JavaScript program, create a new file with the extension .js and add the following code:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

Save the file and open it in a web browser. You should see the message "Hello, World!" displayed in the browser console.

Alternatively, you can also run JavaScript code directly in the browser console. Open the browser console by pressing F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I (Windows) or Command+Option+I (Mac). Type the following code in the console:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

Press Enter, and you should see the message "Hello, World!" displayed in the console.

Congratulations! You have written and run your first JavaScript program.
