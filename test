WEBVTT

00:01.280 --> 00:01.810
In this app.

00:01.820 --> 00:04.550
Let's create an easy to instance and play with it.

00:05.590 --> 00:12.880
The service we would need to use to create an easy instance is easy, too easy to virtual servers in

00:12.880 --> 00:16.030
the cloud, easy to stand for elastic compute cloud.

00:16.480 --> 00:21.760
And when I click Easy to service, you'd be able to see that there are no instances that are running

00:21.760 --> 00:22.810
at this point in time.

00:22.810 --> 00:24.580
So instances running is zero.

00:25.150 --> 00:27.910
Right now I'm making use of the Mumbai region.

00:27.910 --> 00:31.270
I'm in Hyderabad, which is very, very near to Mumbai.

00:31.300 --> 00:33.030
Therefore, I'm choosing the region.

00:33.040 --> 00:34.780
Mumbai Episode one.

00:34.990 --> 00:38.860
You can choose any of the regions which is present in here, which is nearer to you.

00:39.370 --> 00:44.110
However, make sure that once you choose the region, you choose the same region for all the demos.

00:44.560 --> 00:46.930
So let's go ahead and pick up Mumbai from here.

00:47.110 --> 00:50.020
Now, we would want to create an easy to instance.


00:50.260 --> 00:54.670
One of the ways you can launch Easy two instances is by clicking launch instance in here.

00:54.910 --> 00:59.830
Another approach is you can go into instances and you can click a launch instance in here.

01:00.250 --> 01:05.620
Once you click Launch Instant, you'll get a screen where you would need to fill in a lot of details

01:05.620 --> 01:08.410
regarding the instance that we would want to create.

01:09.670 --> 01:12.070
The first thing you need to enter in here is the name.

01:12.100 --> 01:13.480
I'll call this first.

01:13.600 --> 01:15.910
ESI to instance.

01:18.450 --> 01:21.540
I've zoomed in a little bit so that the screen is really clear to you.

01:21.570 --> 01:28.110
The next thing that we would need to choose is something called an AM I, and AMA is a template that

01:28.110 --> 01:29.730
contains the software configuration.

01:29.730 --> 01:34.470
Basically what operating system you would want to use and what are the applications you would want to

01:34.470 --> 01:36.570
install on your instance?

01:37.170 --> 01:40.710
There are a wide variety of images which are provided by eight of us.

01:41.940 --> 01:47.520
What we'll do is we'll pick up a maze on Linux, which is the default energy suggested, and I'll choose

01:47.520 --> 01:51.540
Amazon next to Amy, which is the default one which is suggested in here.

01:51.600 --> 01:54.300
You can also see that this is free to our eligible.

01:55.290 --> 01:58.710
So let's choose the default army, which is suggested in there.

01:59.070 --> 02:02.040
The next thing you need to choose is the instance type.

02:02.880 --> 02:08.700
The AMA is all about software and instance type is all about hardware.

02:09.030 --> 02:12.260
What kind of hardware do you want on your easy to instance?

02:12.270 --> 02:15.270
That's what we are choosing when we are choosing an instance type.

02:15.870 --> 02:20.340
If you click this dropdown in here, you'd see that there are a wide variety of instance types that

02:20.340 --> 02:21.600
are present in blue.

02:21.630 --> 02:27.360
As you can see that each of these instance types has different amount of memory, different number of

02:27.550 --> 02:30.240
CPUs, and they have different pricing.

02:30.540 --> 02:35.010
What I would do for now is to choose the default one, which is suggested, which is to micro.

02:35.040 --> 02:39.360
This comes with one virtual CPU and it comes with one gig of memory.

02:39.870 --> 02:42.840
And as you can see in here, it is free to eligible as well.

02:44.830 --> 02:47.350
The next thing that we would need to choose is the key payer.

02:47.740 --> 02:54.040
You'd want to securely connect to your EC2 instance and the way you can securely connect to these instances

02:54.040 --> 02:55.630
by making use of a key payer.

02:56.320 --> 02:59.500
What we're doing here is we'll go out and create a new key pair.

02:59.680 --> 03:09.640
So I'll create a new key pair and I'll call this ec2 hyphen default and let's say create key payer.

03:13.370 --> 03:17.030
Once you create a pair, it will also be downloaded onto your local machine.

03:17.390 --> 03:21.920
Make sure that you store the key pair securely because anybody who has the keeper will be able to connect

03:21.920 --> 03:23.510
to your easy to instance.

03:23.870 --> 03:26.240
I'll say I love and I'll download the key pair.

03:27.690 --> 03:31.530
And over here you can see that easy to default keypad is chosen by default.

03:31.830 --> 03:33.030
So that looks good.

03:33.810 --> 03:36.930
The next thing we would need to configure is the network settings.

03:37.470 --> 03:41.340
As part of these network settings, one of the most important things that we would need to configure

03:41.370 --> 03:42.990
is a security group.

03:43.350 --> 03:45.750
A security group is a firewall.

03:45.930 --> 03:51.240
Basically, you can control what traffic is allowed into your instance and what traffic can be going

03:51.240 --> 03:53.490
out from your easy to instance.

03:54.480 --> 03:59.940
What we are doing here is to create a new security group and what I would want to do is to allow SSH

03:59.940 --> 04:01.620
traffic from anywhere.

04:01.740 --> 04:06.060
Whenever I would want to connect to the EC2 instance, I would need to ssh into it.

04:06.060 --> 04:09.810
So I would want to have only SSH into my AC two instance.

04:09.810 --> 04:13.230
That's the only thing I'm allowing as part of my security group.

04:15.500 --> 04:20.930
The last thing we would want to configure is this storage that needs to be attached to my easy to instance.

04:21.800 --> 04:24.050
I'll take the defaults for the storage as well.

04:24.530 --> 04:30.020
We are attaching a AGB general purpose route volume with our AC two instance.

04:30.320 --> 04:34.130
Let's quickly review some of the important details that we have configured until now.

04:34.950 --> 04:36.900
We want to create one easy to instance.

04:37.650 --> 04:40.810
We are making use of the Amazon Linux two kernel 5.10.

04:40.830 --> 04:46.770
Army and army is nothing but the operating system and the applications that you would want on your AC

04:46.770 --> 04:47.720
two instance.

04:47.730 --> 04:54.120
We chose the instance type as to micro instance type helps you in choosing what kind of hardware you'd

04:54.120 --> 04:59.340
want for your easy to instance, how many VCP used, how much memory you would want, what kind of IO

04:59.400 --> 05:00.360
speed you would want.

05:00.390 --> 05:03.150
You can choose all that by choosing the instance type.

05:03.780 --> 05:06.330
The next thing we configured is a security group.

05:06.330 --> 05:07.860
Security group is a firewall.

05:08.100 --> 05:14.040
This controls what traffic is allowed into your city instance and what traffic can go outside your easy

05:14.040 --> 05:15.000
to instance.

05:15.330 --> 05:18.570
We also attached a route, volume of size, a GBE.

05:19.110 --> 05:20.970
Let's go ahead and launch this instance.

05:23.850 --> 05:28.590
You can see that it says successfully initiated the launch of this specific instance.

05:28.800 --> 05:32.010
What I can do is I can click that specific instance in here.

05:32.010 --> 05:33.180
So when I click that.

05:34.920 --> 05:39.060
A new page would open up where I'll be able to see that specific instance.

05:39.150 --> 05:43.170
Right now you can see that the instance date of that is pending.

05:44.220 --> 05:48.990
If you give it a few minutes, you would see that the instant state would shift to running.

05:49.590 --> 05:54.690
Now, what I would want to do is I would want to be able to connect to this easy to instance, and I

05:54.690 --> 05:57.630
would want to be able to execute a few commands against it.

05:57.660 --> 05:58.800
How can I do that?

05:59.280 --> 06:02.970
That's where you can select this and you can click Connect.

06:03.730 --> 06:05.800
There are multiple approaches to connecting to your AC.

06:05.800 --> 06:09.700
To instance, what we'll do is we'll make use of easy, to instance, connect.

06:12.350 --> 06:18.380
The default username is easy to hyphen user so you can take the default username and you can say connect.

06:19.670 --> 06:25.610
And within a little while you should see that a new tab opens up where you can go ahead and type in

06:25.610 --> 06:26.630
a few commands.

06:28.020 --> 06:29.420
I'll go in here and type in.

06:29.430 --> 06:30.840
Who am I?

06:32.130 --> 06:33.990
Easy to hyphen user.

06:34.140 --> 06:39.120
I can go in and type in Python hyphen hyphen version.

06:39.510 --> 06:46.230
You can see that Python 2.7. 18 is already installed on this specific easy to instance, if you want,

06:46.230 --> 06:48.720
you can go ahead and install any software that you would want on this.

06:48.720 --> 06:49.350
Easy to install.

06:49.380 --> 06:54.600
For example, if you'd want to install Java or Node.js or if you want or if you don't install go, you

06:54.600 --> 06:57.510
can go ahead and install it on this specific easy to instance.

06:58.260 --> 07:02.310
One of the most important things that you need to understand is the power of what you are doing right

07:02.310 --> 07:02.850
now.

07:05.130 --> 07:06.870
With a click of a few buttons.

07:06.870 --> 07:13.560
We were able to launch a virtual server and we were able to very, very easily connect to it.

07:13.560 --> 07:19.020
And we are now able to execute commands and if we want we can go ahead and install software in it and

07:19.020 --> 07:19.800
play with it.

07:21.860 --> 07:23.420
That's the power of cloud.

07:23.750 --> 07:28.070
You can get access to powerful infrastructure with a click of few buttons.

07:30.590 --> 07:35.120
Let's close this window down and let's go back to our S.E. to instance.

07:35.240 --> 07:39.170
So I'll go back to easy two instances and you can see that right here.

07:39.170 --> 07:43.850
We have one instance running and if I click the instance ID.

07:44.890 --> 07:48.190
I can see all the details about this easy two instance.

07:48.430 --> 07:51.490
You can see that this easy to entrance has an instance ID.

07:51.700 --> 07:54.190
The ID is what is used to uniquely identify this.

07:54.190 --> 07:55.390
Easy to instance.

07:55.660 --> 07:59.820
The easy to instance by default is also assigned a public IP address.

07:59.830 --> 08:04.960
If you install an application on the easy two instance, you can use this public IP address to access

08:04.960 --> 08:06.460
that specific application.

08:07.060 --> 08:11.410
The easy two instance is also assigned a private IP address as well.

08:11.920 --> 08:17.590
This IP address is only available inside the network in which the easy two instance is created.

08:18.280 --> 08:21.340
You can see that the current state of instance is running.

08:22.350 --> 08:25.590
You can also see that the instance type of this is the to micro.

08:26.130 --> 08:30.180
Now there are a number of operations that you can perform on your instance.

08:30.210 --> 08:34.380
If you go to Instant State, you can stop the instance.

08:34.920 --> 08:40.350
You can reboot the instance, basically restart the instance, or you can terminate the instance.

08:40.440 --> 08:43.500
Stopping the instance would only temporarily stop the instance.

08:43.990 --> 08:48.990
You can go ahead and start it at a later point in time, but if you terminate the instance, the instance

08:48.990 --> 08:50.490
will be completely deleted.

08:50.490 --> 08:52.290
You'll not be able to restart it again.

08:53.770 --> 08:57.980
If you scroll down in here, you'll be able to see a lot more details about the easy two instance.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.400
You can see that we are making use of RMS on Linux.

09:00.400 --> 09:07.900
You can see the amide or we can see the amide or the RMS on machine image ID that we are making use

09:07.900 --> 09:08.290
of.

09:08.770 --> 09:11.830
You can also see the key page details and a lot of other details regarding this.

09:11.830 --> 09:18.250
Easy to instance, if you go over to security, you'd be able to see the details of the security group

09:18.250 --> 09:20.380
that we have configured earlier.

09:20.380 --> 09:24.070
When creating ADC two instance, we said we would want to have SSH traffic.

09:24.910 --> 09:27.190
And that's why you can see that in the security group.

09:27.190 --> 09:30.250
It allows traffic on Port 22.

09:31.660 --> 09:35.350
If you go to networking, you can see the networking details of this AC two instance.

09:35.350 --> 09:37.870
You can see the public IP address, private IP address.

09:38.440 --> 09:41.650
You can also see the VPC and the subnet details in here.

09:41.680 --> 09:46.420
VPC and subnets allow you to create your own private network in the cloud.

09:46.510 --> 09:49.660
We'll talk about VPC and subnets a little later in the course.

09:50.080 --> 09:55.570
If you go to storage over here, you can see that there is a hard disk or a virtual drive which is attached

09:55.570 --> 09:57.280
with your AC to instance.

09:57.490 --> 10:02.680
When we created our two instance, we chose that we would want a GB hard disk to be attached.

10:03.160 --> 10:07.030
You can see the details of it in here in statistics.

10:07.030 --> 10:10.400
You can see this current status of your easy to instance.

10:10.420 --> 10:13.840
You can see that all the system statistics are passing.

10:13.840 --> 10:17.290
And also you can see that the instance statistics are also passing.

10:18.540 --> 10:24.120
If you go to monitoring, you can look at all the metrics related to our EC2 instance.

10:24.120 --> 10:28.620
You can see the CPU utilization, you can see the status of the status checks.

10:28.620 --> 10:33.850
You can see how much network traffic is coming in and how much network traffic is going out.

10:33.870 --> 10:36.670
You can see the details of discrete describes.

10:36.690 --> 10:40.800
So if you want to look at metrics related to your easy to instance, you can come to the monitoring

10:40.800 --> 10:45.570
tab enables the service which tracks your metrics is cloud watch.

10:45.870 --> 10:50.970
So what's happening is you easy to instance would send all the metrics to cloud watch and these are

10:50.970 --> 10:56.940
the metrics you are seeing in here and you can also attach tags with your easy to instance.

10:56.940 --> 11:01.520
You can see that there is a tag which is already created name easy to instance.

11:01.530 --> 11:04.320
What I would want is I would want to add more tags.

11:04.320 --> 11:07.710
So I'll go to manage tags and I would want to add a new tag.

11:07.740 --> 11:15.090
I'll call this environment, I'll add a tag called environment and let's say Dev and I'll also add a

11:15.090 --> 11:17.820
tag called Business Unit.

11:17.820 --> 11:19.980
And let's call this business unit a.

11:21.540 --> 11:26.370
Bikes are really, really useful in associating a specific resource in the cloud with, let's say,

11:26.580 --> 11:28.590
environment or a business unit.

11:29.390 --> 11:34.190
Whenever you are working for a large enterprise, you'd want to be able to identify which resource belongs

11:34.190 --> 11:39.500
to which business unit or which environment, so that you can associate costs with that specific environment

11:39.500 --> 11:41.210
or that specific business unit.

11:41.630 --> 11:43.160
So let's go ahead and save this.

11:43.890 --> 11:46.680
In this step, we were able to create our first easy instance.

11:46.680 --> 11:48.750
We were able to connect to it using instance connect.

11:48.750 --> 11:53.280
We were able to execute a few commands against it and we saw that there are a lot of things that you

11:53.280 --> 11:55.350
can do with your AC instance.

11:56.010 --> 12:01.110
Before we end this step, what I would want to do is to terminate this specific, easy to instance in

12:01.110 --> 12:01.590
the cloud.

12:01.590 --> 12:04.800
You don't want to leave the resources running for a long time.

12:05.550 --> 12:10.240
The best practice in the cloud is to always terminate the resources after you play with them.

12:10.260 --> 12:12.030
So what I'll do is I'll select this.

12:12.800 --> 12:16.250
I'd go to Instant State and I would say Terminate instance.

12:17.180 --> 12:19.010
I'd go ahead and say terminate.

12:20.090 --> 12:22.930
We have started the termination of this AC two instance.

12:22.940 --> 12:25.550
The termination of the AC through instance will take a little while.

12:25.580 --> 12:27.830
I recommend you to take a break and I'll see you on.
